ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In today's digital era, movie streaming platforms offer vast libraries, making it difficult for users to decide what to watch next. Our Movie Recommendation System simplifies this process by providing personalized movie suggestions based on user input. The system leverages IMDbâ€™s Top 1000 Movies & TV Shows and identifies recommendations based on matching attributes such as genre, director, cast, and ratings.
